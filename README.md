# Ticman
A unoptimized tic tac bot, uses storage to play good moves. Similar to neural network.



# Info

This bot uses your folder to store bad moves, This way he will never make bad moves.
This is not a great script, but you know, for fun and experience!

# Install Instructions

First, you have to modify configuration in Main.java, change the directory to your folder example: /home/tom/Desktop/NewFolder
If you are on windows: C:\User\tom\Desktop\NewFolder

By the way you have to make folder **manually**.

Then you can compile this java file, by:

**javac Main.java**

after that you can run script:

**java Main**

A introduction should appear.

Of course it is weak, You have to train it. That is why this script is not all best as it take some time to train it.

# Enjoy!

This is almost done, just little fix to make storage optimized.

Thanks.
